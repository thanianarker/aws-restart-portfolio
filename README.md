# 🌩️ AWS re/Start Portfolio 

## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to my **AWS re/Start portfolio**.  
This repository documents my learning journey through the **AWS re/Start program**, where I developed foundational cloud computing, Linux, networking, security, and Python skills, with a strong emphasis on hands-on labs and real-world scenarios.

Coming from a background in **Research Psychology**, this program has allowed me to build technical skills while applying my strengths in **critical thinking, problem-solving, and structured analysis**. This portfolio reflects both my technical growth and my learning mindset as I transition into a cloud-focused career.

## 🌱 Learning Reflections

AWS re/Start challenged me to step outside my comfort zone and think technically and systematically.

- I learned how to break complex cloud architectures into understandable components.  
- Hands-on labs helped bridge the gap between theory and real-world application.  
- Troubleshooting errors improved my patience, persistence, and problem-solving skills.  
- My research background strengthened my ability to document processes clearly and reflect on learning outcomes.  

This program showed me that learning cloud computing is not about memorising services, but about understanding **use cases, trade-offs, and security considerations**.

## 🎯 Goals Going Forward

- Earn the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification  
- Build and deploy small cloud projects  
- Strengthen my AWS security and architecture knowledge  
- Improve my Python skills for cloud automation  
- Transition into an entry-level cloud or support role
