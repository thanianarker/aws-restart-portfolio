# AWS Hybrid Cloud Solution for After Hours Café ☁️☕

## 📌 Project Overview
This project showcases a **hybrid cloud solution built using AWS services** for a small café that hasn’t fully moved to the cloud yet.

The aim was to improve **reliability, security, scalability, and cost management**, while allowing the business to transition to the cloud gradually rather than all at once.

---

## 🏪 Business Scenario
The café currently relies on:
- On-premise systems for daily operations
- Minimal online tools for basic digital services

### Key challenges included:
- System downtime during busy periods
- Risk of data loss due to local storage
- High costs associated with maintaining physical hardware
- Limited ability to scale as the business grows

---

## ☁️ Proposed Cloud Solution
A **hybrid cloud approach using AWS** was implemented:
- Critical systems remain on-site
- Hosting, storage, databases, and backups are moved to AWS

This approach reduces risk while supporting a smoother and more flexible transition to the cloud.

## 🧰 AWS Services Used in Proposed Solution
- **Amazon EC2** – Hosts the café’s applications and website
- **Amazon S3** – Stores static website content, files, and backups
- **Amazon RDS** – Managed relational database service
- **AWS IAM** – Manages user access and permissions
- **Amazon CloudWatch** – Monitors
